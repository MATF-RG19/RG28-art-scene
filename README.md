# RG28-art-scene

The very first attempt to fusion art and computer science by combining sophisticated algorithms with playful visual representation moderated by my eyeballs and my fresh openGL skills.
The animation is generated by perverted idea of particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and additional visual effects - fog, light, textures, shapes. The presented output is just one out of many tried, failed, lost; others could be seen [here](https://github.com/MATF-RG19/RG28-art-scene/tree/master/screenshots).
